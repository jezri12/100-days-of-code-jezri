# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 25, 2022
Well im starting, my hopes are to work on web dev. I hope to learn some frontend and backend frameworks.

Some frameworks I want to learn (at least the basics):

Frontend
- react
- alpinejs
- angular
- vue

Backend
- express
- fastify
- flask

Projects to make
- advanced todo app
- chat app
- online store with auth and accounts
- a calendar / agenda
- a website that tells you the weather with css
- a simple nested wiki
- for now, thats all

### Day 1: March 25, 2022
Well I started work on the Advanced Todo, I set up the dev enviroment and a basic backend using expressjs, as well as a basic html page with a few concepts. I plan using alpinejs for the html frontend, but I may go with pure html, css and js. I also went from 60% on the "html and html5 basics" course on freecodecamp to 100%.

### Day 2: March 26, 2022
Too busy didnt do anything

### Day 3: March 27, 2022
I iplemented some basic comunication between the client and the server aswell as starting to implement sqlite for the database of the server.

### Day 4: March 28, 2022
I basically completed sqlite implementation on the server. I also implemented querying and data sending to the client.

### Day 5: March 29, 2022
Worked on some lessons on freeCodeCamp

### Day 6: March 30, 2022
Started work on how the frontend of ATA should look, decided that my way of getting data was not very practical so I did a complete revamp. At first I wanted to us Alpinejs but since I ran into some problems I decided to use Jquery. I had never used AJAX and its amazing honestly. Its so straight foward and without convolutions. Also, implementing the UI revamp with JQuery was so great, it feels as if im alot more in control with my code and how it works, other frameworks almost felt limiting in a way.

### Day 7: March 31, 2022
Completed FlexFroggy, it was very fun. I didnt have much time so tomorrow I plan on implementing some of what I learn in a basic project.

### Day 8: April 1, 2022
Tried implementing some css, I dislike css honestly
